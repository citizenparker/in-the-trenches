## Open Questions
* Use String Railway as inspiration and create a “battlefield” with a piece of string. You can only play cards that are connected to your home base or one of the facedown 5/0 cards in friendly territory. (this eliminates much of the utility of cheap cards though if you don’t need continuous lines from base to enemies)
* How many players should this support? Most cards are written to allow multiple players, but I think this should likely be just 2 for now. In multiplayer, would need better mechanisms to replay cards.
* Should I swap the 5 and 6 effects?

## Misc Card Effect Ideas
* “Enemies bordering this card are not considered connected to their owner’s base.” (formerly the 10 effect) 

* “For the purposes of connection only, you may consider one bordering enemy to be a friendly” ? This should be a weak, weak card
