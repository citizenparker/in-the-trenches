## Open Questions
* Use String Railway as inspiration and create a “battlefield” with a piece of string. You can only play cards that are connected to your home base or one of the facedown 5/0 cards in friendly territory. (this eliminates much of the utility of cheap cards though if you don’t need continuous lines from base to enemies)
* How many players should this support? Most cards are written to allow multiple players, but I think this should likely be just 2 for now. In multiplayer, would need better mechanisms to replay cards.
* Should I swap the 5 and 6 effects?

## Misc Card Effect Ideas
* “Enemies bordering this card are not considered connected to their owner’s base.” (formerly the 10 effect) 

* “For the purposes of connection only, you may consider one bordering enemy to be a friendly” ? This should be a weak, weak card

## Theme?

Alternate world WW1 theme (title: “In the Trenches”)?

Give each player a lightweight faction that gives them a unique power - something that isn’t game changing but gives the flavor of a distinct major power and would be used 2-3 times per game.

(idea: keep faction face-down until it is first used?)

#### For Example
**Muskovy (Russia)** - Mass Mobilization - For three actions, you may draw 5 cards.

**Riviere (France)** - Valor & Sacrifice - For one action, you may trash a card from your hand. If you do so, take a played friendly into hand.

**Aschaffen (Germany)** - Power & Strength - When dominating, you may grant one friendly +1 value. After this action, discard that friendly.

**Welland (England)** - A Kingdom United - All your face down cards have value four. You may play any card face down as a four strength, no cost, no effect card.

**The Concordant Republics (U.S.)** - Scientific Progress - For one action, you may select one card from your discard and place it on the bottom of your deck.
